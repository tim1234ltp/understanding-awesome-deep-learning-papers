Microsoft Research
Abstract Deep residual networks [1] have emerged as a family of extremely deep architectures showing compelling accuracy and nice convergence behaviors. In this paper, we analyze the propagation formulations behind the residual building blocks, which suggest that the forward and backward signals can be directly propagated from one block to any other block, when using identity mappings as the skip connections and after-addition activation. A series of ablation experiments support the importance of these identity mappings. This motivates us to propose a new residual unit, which further makes training easy and improves generalization. We report improved results using a 1001-layer ResNet on CIFAR-10 (4.62% error) and CIFAR-100, and a 200-layer ResNet on ImageNet. Code is available at: https://github.com/KaimingHe/ resnet-1k-layers.
1 Introduction
Deep residual networks (ResNets) [1] consist of many stacked "Residual Units". Each unit (Fig. 1 (a)) can be expressed in a general form:
yl = h(xl) + F (xl, Wl), xl+1 = f (yl),
where xl and xl+1 are input and output of the l-th unit, and F is a residual function. In [1], h(xl) = xl is an identity mapping and f is a ReLU [2] function.
ResNets that are over 100-layer deep have shown state-of-the-art accuracy for several challenging recognition tasks on ImageNet [3] and MS COCO [4] competitions. The central idea of ResNets is to learn the additive residual function F with respect to h(xl), with a key choice of using an identity mapping h(xl) = xl. This is realized by attaching an identity skip connection ("shortcut").
In this paper, we analyze deep residual networks by focusing on creating a "direct" path for propagating information -- not only within a residual unit, but through the entire network. Our derivations reveal that if both h(xl) and f (yl) are identity mappings, the signal could be directly propagated from one unit to any other units, in both forward and backward passes. Our experiments empirically show that training in general becomes easier when the architecture is closer to the above two conditions.
To understand the role of skip connections, we analyze and compare various types of h(xl). We find that the identity mapping h(xl) = xl chosen in [1] achieves the fastest error reduction and lowest training loss among all variants

The proposed unit makes ResNet-1001 easier to train.

we investigated, whereas skip connections of scaling, gating [5,6,7], and 1×1 convolutions all lead to higher training loss and error. These experiments suggest that keeping a "clean" information path (indicated by the grey arrows in Fig. 1, 2, and 4) is helpful for easing optimization.
To construct an identity mapping f (yl) = yl, we view the activation functions (ReLU and BN [8]) as "pre-activation" of the weight layers, in contrast to conventional wisdom of "post-activation". This point of view leads to a new residual unit design, shown in (Fig. 1(b)). Based on this unit, we present competitive results on CIFAR-10/100 with a 1001-layer ResNet, which is much easier to train and generalizes better than the original ResNet in [1]. We further report improved results on ImageNet using a 200-layer ResNet, for which the counterpart of [1] starts to overfit. These results suggest that there is much room to exploit the dimension of network depth, a key to the success of modern deep learning.

2 Analysis of Deep Residual Networks

The ResNets developed in [1] are modularized architectures that stack building blocks of the same connecting shape. In this paper we call these blocks "Residual Units". The original Residual Unit in [1] performs the following computations:

yl = h(xl) + F (xl, Wl),

(1)

xl+1 = f (yl).

(2)

3

Here xl is the input feature to the l-th Residual Unit. Wl = {Wl,k|1kK } is a set of weights (and biases) associated with the l-th Residual Unit, and K is the

number of layers in a Residual Unit (K is 2 or 3 in [1]). F denotes the residual

function, e.g., a stack of two 3×3 convolutional layers in [1]. The function f is

the operation after element-wise addition, and in [1] f is ReLU. The function h

is set as an identity mapping: h(xl) = xl. If f is also an identity mapping: xl+1  yl, we can put Eqn.(2) into Eqn.(1)
and obtain:

xl+1 = xl + F (xl, Wl).

(3)

Recursively (xl+2 = xl+1 + F (xl+1, Wl+1) = xl + F (xl, Wl) + F (xl+1, Wl+1), etc.) we
will have:
L-1

xL = xl + F (xi, Wi),

(4)

i=l

for any deeper unit L and any shallower unit l. Eqn.(4) exhibits some nice

properties. (i) The feature xL of any deeper unit L can be represented as the

feature xl of any shallower unit l plus a residual function in a form of

L-1 i=l

F

,

indicating that the model is in a residual fashion between any units L and l. (ii)

The feature xL = x0 +

L-1 i=0

F (xi, Wi),

of

any

deep

unit

L,

is

the

summation

of the outputs of all preceding residual functions (plus x0). This is in contrast to

a "plain network" where a feature xL is a series of matrix-vector products, say,

L-1 i=0

Wi

x0

.

Eqn.(4) also leads to nice backward propagation properties. Denoting the

loss function as E, from the chain rule of backpropagation [9] we have:

E = E xL = E xl xL xl xL

 L-1

1+ xl

i=l

F (xi, Wi)

.

(5)

Eqn.(5)

that

and

that propagates

The additive term of

E xL

ensures that

information

is

directly propagated back to any shallower unit l. Eqn.(5) also suggests that it

is

for

the

out,

because

This

layer does not vanish even when the weights are arbitrarily small.

Discussions
Eqn.(4) and Eqn.(5) suggest that the signal can be directly propagated from any unit to one another, both forwardly and backwardly. The foundation of Eqn.(4) is two identity mappings: (i) the identity skip connection h(xl) = xl, and (ii) the condition that f is an identity mapping.

4
These directly propagated information flows are represented by the grey arrows in Fig. 1, 2, and 4. And the above two conditions are true when these grey arrows cover no operations (expect addition) and thus are "clean". In the following two sections we separately investigate the impacts of the two conditions.
It is noteworthy that there are Residual Units for increasing dimensions and reducing feature map sizes [1], which do not strictly follow the above formulations. But as there are only a very few such units (two on CIFAR and three on ImageNet, depending on image sizes [1]), we expect that they affect little on degrading propagation. On the other hand, one may think of the above derivations as applied to all Residual Units within the same feature map size.

3 On the Importance of Identity Skip Connections

Let's consider a simple modification, h(xl) = lxl, to break the identity shortcut:

xl+1 = lxl + F (xl, Wl),

(6)

where l is a modulating scalar (for simplicity we still assume f is identity).

Recursively applying this formulation we obtain an equation similar to Eqn. (4):

xL =

L-1 i=l

ixl

+

L-1 i=l

L-1 j=i+1

jF (xi,

Wi),

or

simply:

L-1

L-1

xL = ixl + F^(xi, Wi),

(7)

i=l

i=l

where the notation F^ absorbs the scalars into the residual functions. Similar to Eqn.(5), we have backpropagation of the following form:

E E =
xl xL

L-1
i
i=l

+

 xl

L-1
F^(xi, Wi)
i=l

.

(8)

Unlike Eqn.(5), in Eqn.(8) the first additive term is modulated by a factor

L-1 i=l

i.

For

an

extremely

deep

network

(L

is

large),

if

i

>

1

for

all

i,

this

factor can be exponentially large; if i < 1 for all i, this factor can be expo-

nentially small and vanish, which blocks the backpropagated signal from the

shortcut and forces it to flow through the weight layers. This results in opti-

mization difficulties as we show by experiments.

In the above analysis, the original identity skip connection in Eqn.(3) is re-

placed with a simple scaling h(xl) = lxl. If the skip connection h(xl) represents

more complicated transforms (such as gating and 1×1 convolutions), in Eqn.(8)

the first term becomes

L-1 i=l

hi

where

h

is the derivative of h. This product

may also impede information propagation and hamper the training procedure

as witnessed in the following experiments.

The shortcut connections in (b-f) are impeded by different components. For simplifying illustrations we do not display the BN layers, which are adopted right after the weight layers for all units here.

3.1 Experiments on Skip Connections
We experiment with the 110-layer ResNet as presented in [1] on CIFAR-10 [10]. This extremely deep ResNet-110 has 54 two-layer Residual Units (consisting of 3×3 convolutional layers) and is challenging for optimization. Our implementation details (see appendix) are the same as [1]. Throughout this paper we report the median accuracy of 5 runs for each architecture on CIFAR, reducing the impacts of random variations.
Though our above analysis is driven by identity f , the experiments in this section are all based on f = ReLU as in [1]; we address identity f in the next section. Our baseline ResNet-110 has 6.61% error on the test set. The comparisons of other variants (Fig. 2 and Table 1) are summarized as follows:
Constant scaling. We set  = 0.5 for all shortcuts (Fig. 2(b)). We further study two cases of scaling F: (i) F is not scaled; or (ii) F is scaled by a constant scalar of 1 -  = 0.5, which is similar to the highway gating [6,7] but with frozen gates. The former case does not converge well; the latter is able to converge, but the test error (Table 1, 12.35%) is substantially higher than the original ResNet-110. Fig 3(a) shows that the training error is higher than that of the original ResNet-110, suggesting that the optimization has difficulties when the shortcut signal is scaled down.

Exclusive gating. Following the Highway Networks [6,7] that adopt a gating

mechanism [5], we consider a gating function g(x) = (Wgx + bg) where a

transform is represented by weights Wg and biases bg followed by the sigmoid

function

(x)

=

1 1+e-x

.

In

a

convolutional

network

g(x)

is

realized

by

a

1×1

convolutional layer. The gating function modulates the signal by element-wise

multiplication.

We investigate the "exclusive" gates as used in [6,7] -- the F path is scaled

by g(x) and the shortcut path is scaled by 1-g(x). See Fig 2(c). We find that the

initialization of the biases bg is critical for training gated models, and following the guidelines1 in [6,7], we conduct hyper-parameter search on the initial value of

bg in the range of 0 to -10 with a decrement step of -1 on the training set by crossvalidation. The best value (-6 here) is then used for training on the training

set, leading to a test result of 8.70% (Table 1), which still lags far behind the

ResNet-110 baseline. Fig 3(b) shows the training curves. Table 1 also reports the

results of using other initialized values, noting that the exclusive gating network

does not converge to a good solution when bg is not appropriately initialized. The impact of the exclusive gating mechanism is two-fold. When 1 - g(x)

approaches 1, the gated shortcut connections are closer to identity which helps

information propagation; but in this case g(x) approaches 0 and suppresses the

function F. To isolate the effects of the gating functions on the shortcut path

alone, we investigate a non-exclusive gating mechanism in the next.

Shortcut-only gating. In this case the function F is not scaled; only the shortcut path is gated by 1 - g(x). See Fig 2(d). The initialized value of bg is still essential in this case. When the initialized bg is 0 (so initially the expectation of 1 - g(x) is 0.5), the network converges to a poor result of 12.86% (Table 1). This is also caused by higher training error (Fig 3(c)).

Figure 3. Training curves on CIFAR-10 of various shortcuts. Solid lines denote test error (y-axis on the right), and dashed lines denote training loss (y-axis on the left).

When the initialized bg is very negatively biased (e.g., -6), the value of 1 - g(x) is closer to 1 and the shortcut connection is nearly an identity mapping. As such, the result (6.91%, Table 1) is much closer to the ResNet-110 baseline.
1×1 convolutional shortcut. Next we experiment with 1×1 convolutional shortcut connections that replace the identity. This option has been investigated in [1] (known as option C) on a 34-layer ResNet (16 Residual Units) and shows good results, suggesting that 1×1 shortcut connections could be useful. But we find that this is not the case when there are many Residual Units. The 110-layer ResNet has a poorer result (12.22%, Table 1) when using 1×1 convolutional shortcuts. Again, the training error becomes higher (Fig 3(d)). When stacking so many Residual Units (54 for ResNet-110), even the shortest path may still impede signal propagation. We witnessed similar phenomena on ImageNet with ResNet-101 when using 1×1 convolutional shortcuts.
Dropout shortcut. Last we experiment with dropout [11] (at a ratio of 0.5) which we adopt on the output of the identity shortcut (Fig. 2(f)). The network fails to converge to a good solution. Dropout statistically imposes a scale of  with an expectation of 0.5 on the shortcut, and similar to constant scaling by 0.5, it impedes signal propagation.

3.2 Discussions
As indicated by the grey arrows in Fig. 2, the shortcut connections are the most direct paths for the information to propagate. Multiplicative manipulations (scaling, gating, 1×1 convolutions, and dropout) on the shortcuts can hamper information propagation and lead to optimization problems.
It is noteworthy that the gating and 1×1 convolutional shortcuts introduce more parameters, and should have stronger representational abilities than identity shortcuts. In fact, the shortcut-only gating and 1×1 convolution cover the solution space of identity shortcuts (i.e., they could be optimized as identity shortcuts). However, the degradation of these complex shortcut models is caused by optimization issues, instead of representational abilities.
4 On the Usage of Activation Functions
Experiments in the above section are consistent with the analysis in Eqn.(5) and Eqn.(8), both being derived under the assumption that the after-addition

9
activation f is the identity mapping. But in the above experiments f is ReLU as designed in [1]. Next we investigate the impact of f .
We want to make f an identity mapping, which is done by re-arranging the activation functions (ReLU and/or BN). The original Residual Unit in [1] has a shape in Fig. 4(a) -- BN is used after each weight layer, and ReLU is adopted after BN except that the last ReLU in a Residual Unit is after elementwise addition (f = ReLU). Fig. 4(b-e) show the alternatives we investigated, explained as following.

4.1 Experiments on Activation
In this section we experiment with ResNet-110 and a 164-layer Bottleneck [1] architecture (denoted as ResNet-164). A bottleneck Residual Unit consist of a 1×1 layer for reducing dimension, a 3×3 layer, and a 1×1 layer for storing dimension. As designed in [1], its computational complexity is similar to the two-3×3 Residual Unit. More details are in the appendix. The baseline ResNet164 has a competitive result of 5.93% on CIFAR-10 (Table 2).
BN after addition. Before turning f into an identity mapping, we go the opposite way by adopting BN after addition (Fig. 4(b)). In this case f involves BN and ReLU. The results become considerably worse than the baseline (Table 2). Unlike the original design, now the BN layer alters the signal that passes through the shortcut and impedes information propagation, as reflected by the difficulties on reducing training loss at the beginning of training (Fib. 6 left).
ReLU before addition. A na¨ive choice of making f into an identity mapping is to move the ReLU before addition (Fig. 4(c)). However, this leads to a non-negative output from the transform F, while intuitively a "residual" function should take values in (-, +). As a result, the forward propagated signal is monotonically increasing. This may impact the representational ability, and the result is worse (7.84%, Table 2) than the baseline. We expect to have a residual function taking values in (-, +). This condition is satisfied by other Residual Units including the following ones.
Post-activation or pre-activation? In the original design (Eqn.(1) and Eqn.(2)), the activation xl+1 = f (yl) affects both paths in the next Residual Unit: yl+1 = f (yl) + F (f (yl), Wl+1). Next we develop an asymmetric form where an activation f^ only affects the F path: yl+1 = yl + F (f^(yl), Wl+1), for any l (Fig. 5 (a) to (b)). By renaming the notations, we have the following form:

xl+1 = xl + F (f^(xl), Wl), .

(9)

It is easy to see that Eqn.(9) is similar to Eqn.(4), and can enable a backward
formulation similar to Eqn.(5). For this new Residual Unit as in Eqn.(9), the new
after-addition activation becomes an identity mapping. This design means that if a new after-addition activation f^ is asymmetrically adopted, it is equivalent to recasting f^ as the pre-activation of the next Residual Unit. This is illustrated
in Fig. 5.

The distinction between post-activation/pre-activation is caused by the presence of the element-wise addition. For a plain network that has N layers, there are N - 1 activations (BN/ReLU), and it does not matter whether we think of them as post- or pre-activations. But for branched layers merged by addition, the position of activation matters.
We experiment with two such designs: (i) ReLU-only pre-activation (Fig. 4(d)), and (ii) full pre-activation (Fig. 4(e)) where BN and ReLU are both adopted before weight layers. Table 2 shows that the ReLU-only pre-activation performs very similar to the baseline on ResNet-110/164. This ReLU layer is not used in conjunction with a BN layer, and may not enjoy the benefits of BN [8].
Somehow surprisingly, when BN and ReLU are both used as pre-activation, the results are improved by healthy margins (Table 2 and Table 3). In Table 3 we report results using various architectures: (i) ResNet-110, (ii) ResNet-164, (iii) a 110-layer ResNet architecture in which each shortcut skips only 1 layer (i.e.,

We also experiment on CIFAR100. Table 3 shows that our "pre-activation" models are consistently better than the baseline counterparts. We analyze these results in the following.
4.2 Analysis
We find that the impact of pre-activation is twofold. First, the optimization is further eased (comparing with the baseline ResNet) because f is an identity mapping. Second, using BN as pre-activation improves regularization of the models.
Ease of optimization. This effect is particularly obvious when training the 1001-layer ResNet. Fig. 1 shows the curves. Using the original design in [1], the training error is reduced very slowly at the beginning of training. For f = ReLU, the signal is impacted if it is negative, and when there are many Residual Units, this effect becomes prominent and Eqn.(3) (so Eqn.(5)) is not a good approximation. On the contrary, when f is an identity mapping, the signal can be propagated directly between any two units. Our 1001-layer network reduces the training loss very quickly (Fig. 1). It also achieves the lowest loss among all models we investigated, suggesting the success of optimization.
We also find that the impact of f = ReLU is not severe when the ResNet has fewer layers (e.g., 164 in Fig. 6(right)). The training curve seems to suffer a little bit at the beginning of training, but goes into a healthy status soon. By monitoring the responses we observe that this is because after some training, the weights are adjusted into a status such that yl in Eqn.(1) is more frequently above zero and f does not truncate it (xl is always non-negative due to the previous ReLU, so yl is below zero only when the magnitude of F is very negative). The truncation, however, is more frequent when there are 1000 layers.

Reducing overfitting. Another impact of using the proposed pre-activation unit is on regularization, as shown in Fig. 6 (right). The pre-activation version reaches slightly higher training loss at convergence, but produces lower test error. This phenomenon is observed on ResNet-110, ResNet-110(1-layer), and ResNet-164 on both CIFAR-10 and 100. This is presumably caused by BN's regularization effect [8]. In the original Residual Unit (Fig. 4(a)), although the BN normalizes the signal, this is soon added to the shortcut and thus the merged signal is not normalized. This unnormalized signal is then used as the input of the next weight layer. On the contrary, in our pre-activation version, the inputs to all weight layers have been normalized.
4.3 Comparisons with state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10/100
Table 4 compares the state-of-the-art methods on CIFAR-10/100, where we achieve competitive results. We remark that we do not specially tailor the network filter sizes/numbers, nor use regularization techniques (such as dropout) which are very effective for these small datasets. We obtain these results via a simple but essential concept -- going deeper. These results demonstrate the potential of pushing the limits of depth.
4.4 Experiments on ImageNet
Lastly we report experimental results on the 1000-class ImageNet dataset [3]. We have done preliminary experiments using the skip connections studied in Fig. 3 on ImageNet with ResNet-101 [1] , and observed similar optimization difficulties. The training error of these non-identity shortcut networks is obviously higher than the original ResNet at the first learning rate (similar to Fig. 3), and we

decided to halt training due to limited resources. Nevertheless, we did finish a "BN after addition" version (Fig. 4(b)) of ResNet-101 on ImageNet and observed higher training loss and validation error. This model's single-crop (224×224) validation error is 24.6%/7.5%, vs. the original ResNet-101's 23.6%/7.1%2. This comparison is in line with CIFAR's results in Fig. 6 (left).
Table 5 shows the results of ResNet-152 [1] and ResNet-2003, all trained from scratch. We notice that the original ResNet paper [1] trained the models using scale jittering with shorter side s  [256, 480], and so the test of a 224×224 crop on s = 256 (as did in [1]) is negatively biased. Instead, we test a single 320×320 crop from s = 320, for all original and our ResNets. Even though the ResNets are trained on smaller crops, they can be easily tested on larger crops because the ResNets are fully convolutional by design. This size is also close to 299×299 used by Inception v3 [17], allowing a fairer comparison.
The original ResNet-152 [1] has top-1 error of 21.3% on a 320×320 crop, and our pre-activation counterpart has 21.1%. The gain is not big on ResNet-152 because this model has not shown severe generalization difficulties. However, the original ResNet-200 has an error rate of 21.8%, higher than the baseline ResNet-152. On the other hand, the original ResNet-200 has lower training loss than ResNet-152, suggesting that it starts to overfit.
Our pre-activation ResNet-200 has an error rate of 20.7%, which is 1.1% lower than the baseline ResNet-200 and also lower than the two versions of ResNet-152. The result of our ResNet-200 compares favorably to Inception v3 (Table 5). Concurrent with our work, an Inception-ResNet-v2 model [18] achieves a single-crop result of 19.9%/4.9%. We expect our observations and the proposed Residual Unit will help this type and generally other types of ResNets.

5 Conclusions
This paper investigates the propagation formulations behind the connection mechanisms of deep residual networks. Our derivations imply that identity shortcut connections and identity after-addition activation are essential for making

information propagation smooth. Ablation experiments demonstrate phenomena that are consistent with our derivations. We also present 1000-layer deep networks that can be easily trained and achieve improved accuracy.

Appendix: Implementation Details

The implementation details and hyper-parameters are the same as those in [1].

Specifically, on CIFAR we use only the translation and flipping augmentation in

[1] for training. The learning rate starts from 0.1, and is divided by 10 at 32k

and 48k iterations. Following [1], for all CIFAR experiments we warm up the

training by using a smaller learning rate of 0.01 at the beginning 400 iterations

and go back to 0.1 after that, although we remark that this is not necessary for

our proposed Residual Unit. The mini-batch size is 128 on 2 GPUs (64 each),

the weight decay is 0.0001, the momentum is 0.9, and the weights are initialized

as in [19].

On ImageNet, we train the models using the same data augmentation as in

[1]. The learning rate starts from 0.1 (no warming up), and is divided by 10 at

30 and 60 epochs. The mini-batch size is 256 on 8 GPUs (32 each). The weight

decay, momentum, and weight initialization are the same as above.

When using the pre-activation Residual Units (Fig. 4(d)(e) and Fig. 5), we

pay special attention to the first and the last Residual Units of the entire net-

work. For the first Residual Unit (that follows a stand-alone convolutional layer,

conv1), we adopt the first activation right after conv1 and before splitting into two paths; for the last Residual Unit (followed by average pooling and a fully-

connected classifier), we adopt an extra activation right after its element-wise

addition. These two special cases are the natural outcome when we obtain the

pre-activation network via the modification procedure as shown in Fig. 5.

The bottleneck Residual Units (for ResNet-164/1001 on CIFAR) are con-

structed following [1]. For example, a 3×3, 16 unit in ResNet-110 is replaced 3×3, 16





with a

1×1, 16  3×3, 16 

unit in ResNet-164, both of which have roughly the same num-





1×1, 64

ber of parameters. For the bottleneck ResNets, when reducing the feature map

size we use projection shortcuts [1] for increasing dimensions, and when pre-

activation is used, these projection shortcuts are also with pre-activation.
